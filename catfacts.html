             "In the Middle Ages in England, all cats – but black colored ones in particular – were often associated with evil and witchcraft. Some people believed black cats were demons who helped witches to perform black magic. Others thought the cats were witches themselves, and even believed they could fly on a broomstick!",

             "Many early Pagans, especially elderly female Pagans, were known for having a cat, especially a black cat. Due to the Pagan belief in the earth and magic, as well as their refusal to convert to Christianity, many of the early Christians perceived them as being devil-worshipers and their pet cats were included in this mix.",
